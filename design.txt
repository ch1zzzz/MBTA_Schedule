# Write down your multi-threading designs here!
for every train and passenger, create a thread, add them into a list.
In the thread, I first make an infinite loop so that the thread can run all the time
until the end check success; in the loop, call lock(), then check if the thread can run,
if false, call await(), if true, make the event and the log, change the state of mbta;
then call signalAll(), unlock();
run all the thread in the list, then check end every 2 seconds.
